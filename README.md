## Why Omelette du Fromage
If you have ever had the itch to learn another language, look not further. The reason why our app is so great for learning French is because it uses a Spaced Repitition algorithm to enchance your learning. What this means essentially is you will see the words you get incorrect more frequently, so you will be able to review and repeat these words so you can improve were you struggle the most.

## What is Omelette du Fromage
A place to go and learn French. Simple as that. After you log in, there will be a French word and an input box for you to type in the english version of that word. If you get the answer right, that word will go to the back of the line so to speak. If you get an answer wrong, it will only go 2 spaces back, so you will see that word again very soon. When you get an answer wrong, it will tell you what the correct answer is. Our app also stores how many times you get every word correct. So when you come back to learn again, Your results from last time will be saved. This shows the user were their strong and weakpoints are.
